# PF2e Hazard Building Guide

## Building Hazards

Building hazards designed for your game allows you to customize them to match your story, location, and needs, as well as to surprise the other players at every turn. There’s no wrong way to create a hazard, but this guide presents the information in the order you might see it in a hazard stat block.

---

## Concept

The first thing you’ll need is a concept for your hazard.

- What level is your hazard?
- Will it be simple or complex?
- Is it a trap, a haunt, an environmental hazard, or something else?
- If it’s a trap, is it mechanical, magical, or both?

Brainstorming the hazard’s name and description early helps decide how the hazard can be disabled.

---

## Hazard Types

There are three main types of hazards: **traps**, **environmental hazards**, and **haunts**.

### Traps
Traps are usually built or placed but can form accidentally (e.g., malfunctioning magical portals).

- Mechanical traps have physical components.
- Magical traps may be affected by *dispel magic*.
- Magical traps with no Stealth rank can be found with *detect magic*.
- **Thievery** is the most common disabling skill.

### Environmental Hazards
These include dangerous organisms (molds, spores) or natural dangers (avalanches, quicksand).

- Always physical.
- Some can’t be reasonably attacked or damaged.
- **Survival** is commonly used to disable them.

### Haunts
Haunts are spiritual hazards caused by the residual essence of death or trauma.

- Usually lack physical form.
- Sometimes interact only with vitality damage or incorporeal traits.
- **Religion** (exorcism) is common for disabling.
- Haunts may reoccur until their unfinished business is resolved.
- Successfully disabling often provides clues to end them permanently.

---

## Understanding and Choosing Statistics

Statistics determine:

- How dangerous the hazard is.
- How difficult it is to disable.
- How hard it is to avoid.

Each stat should be categorized:

- **Extreme** – The hazard’s pinnacle trait (Stealth, Disable, Save DC, etc.).
- **High** – Strong and challenging.
- **Low** – A weakness or vulnerability.

If you need numbers below Low, borrow terrible values from creature creation or choose arbitrary low values.

# Stealth and Disable

Determine how the hazard is found and disabled.

- Hidden hazards have high Stealth DCs.
- Visible hazards often have high Disable DCs instead.

Hazards without Stealth rank:
- Are automatically noticed without Searching.
- If magical, are not protected from *detect magic*.

### Complex Hazard Stealth Modifiers
If you need a Stealth **modifier**, subtract **10** from its Stealth DC.

| 9–18 | Master | Expert |
| 19+ | Legendary | Master |

# Defenses

Physical hazards need these stats:

- **AC** (Extreme / High / Low)
- **Fortitude Save**
- **Reflex Save**
- **Hardness**
- **Hit Points** (and **Broken Threshold** = half HP)

Purely magical or formless hazards may skip AC/HP entirely.

Some hazards shouldn’t have high Hardness; in these cases, use creature HP instead.

Large or complex hazards may have multiple destructible components.

**\***Broken Threshold = half HP.

# Offense

Hazards usually need:

- An **attack bonus** or **save DC**
- A **damage expression**

**Simple hazards**  
- Deal about twice as much damage  
- Have very high attack bonuses  

**Complex hazards**  
- Weaker attacks but repeatable damage  
- Can be encounters by themselves  

Use creature-building attack tables if further tuning is needed.

# Designing Simple Hazards

Simple hazards need:

- An engaging trigger  
- A meaningful effect  

Avoid hazards that only deal damage without adding gameplay value. A good simple hazard:

- Creates consequences  
- Interacts with the environment  
- Enhances encounter design  

---

# Designing Complex Hazards

Complex hazards can function like full encounters.

Characteristics:

- Repeatable damage  
- Action-based routines  
- Multiple points of interaction  
- Often require teamwork to disable  

A good complex hazard feels like a creature in combat but with unique, environmental mechanics.

---

# Building Routines

Complex hazards act every round, driven by:

- Programming (traps)
- Emotions/artifacts (haunts)
- Natural forces (environmental hazards)

Guidelines:

- Routines should match the hazard’s nature.
- Not all hazards target PCs directly (e.g., lava chutes).
- Haunts may selectively target living creatures.
- Splitting routines into multiple actions can allow:
  - Partial disabling
  - Reduced danger
  - Tactical player engagement
