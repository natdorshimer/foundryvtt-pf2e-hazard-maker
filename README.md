A Foundry VTT module designed for Pathfinder 2E System, that allows you to create hazards from scratch, using values from the Pathfinder 2e Building Hazards Guide: https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=2864. 

To use the Hazard Maker, you have to create a blank Hazard. Using a non-blank sheet is possible, but DCs and other special abilities will not scale. 

When you open its Sheet, you can find a button at the top. Clicking this button will open the hazard builder.

By default, all values are moderate, meaning you will get a hazard that does not possess strengths or weaknesses. Whenever you give a hazard a strength, don't forget to give it a weakness to compensate. When you are happy with your values for the hazard, click the "Submit" button. This will override the current values on the sheet.

Below are the images of the form:
First part contains all of the important values like Hit Points, Level, Name etc.
The Second part contains all of the skills as well as the Submit Button
